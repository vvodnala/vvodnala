# Feedback on Final

Overall you did some good programming in this project.

I appreciate the use of functions to encapsulate work, but some of your functions don't have much value.  They just do what another function already does.  There isn't any value in creating a function like `drop_duplicates()` and just calls `df.drop_duplicates()` is there?

Your function for calculating month doesn't quite make sense.  Dates don't work by saying "time / 30" = "month". In the end, your "month" chart doesn't make sense either, noly showing 10 months.

I like seeing visualizations, but I'm not sure your conclustions make sense.

In your conclusions, you provide some very short answers that didn't dig very deep into the data.  I would have like 

* Data Access and Formats (5): 5
* Data Merging (5): 4
* Data Aggregation and Pivoting (5): 5
* Data Transformation (5): 5
* Data Visualization (5): 5
* Problem Applicability (5): 5
* Modularity / Style (15): 10
* Documentation and Processionalism (15): 5
